# OneML

Idea: An App which is a social platform for all machine learning enthusiast where they can login and post things about machine learning and can read other's post. We will make a website which will help users to visualise machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Image Segmentation etc. 

## Features of App 
1. A social platform which will allow user to login via email. 
2. Users can post images and text. 
3. Users can read post of other users.
4. Users can read about different machine learning algorithms from the best resources. 
5. Users can send message to other user.
6. A fun ML section which will use ML-Kit and user will be able to use machine learning feature to classify images and many more.

Basically it will be social app encorporated with machine learning features.

## Features of Website
1. Visualisation of different machine learning models
2. Live Examples to test
3. Provide API's for the ML model
4. Some cool Ml powered filters
5. Powered by AWS Lambda Functions and Serverless
6. Preprocessing of Data

## How to Run this :

### For App: 

1. Install expo on mobile and login into that.
2. Clone the project from the github using "git clone https://github.com/abhaykatheria/Hack36-fnatics.git"
3. Now change the directory to the root folder. i.e "Hack36-fnatics/App"
4. Now run command "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
5. Now enable the USB Debugging of your mobile phone. (This can be achieved by enabling the developer mode)
6. Now run command "npm start".
7. Now will see and expo client server opened in your default browser.
8. Connect your mobile via usb to the system.
9. Install adb first onto your system and run command 'adb devices' to see whether your mobile is connected properly or not.
10. Now go to the page on browser where expo client was opened.
11. Change the portal from LAN to Local and then run on android or ios depending upon your device.
12. This way app build will be successful.

### For Website:

1. Go to the directory Website/OneMl of above cloned repo.
2. Simply run " python manage.py runserver ".
