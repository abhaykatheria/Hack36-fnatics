Topic: Smart Education 

Idea: An App which is a social platform for all machine learning enthusiast where they can login and post things about machine learning and can read other's post. We will make a website which will help users to visualise machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Image Segmentation etc. 

## Features of App 
1. A social platform which will allow user to login via email. 
2. Users can post images and text. 
3. Users can read post of other users.
4. Users can read about different machine learning algorithms from the best resources. 
5. Users can send message to other user.
6. A fun ML section which will use ML-Kit and user will be able to use machine learning feature to classify images and many more.

Basically it will be social app encorporated with machine learning features.

## Features of Website
1. Visualisation of different machine learning models
2. Live Examples to test
3. Provide API's for the ML model
4. Some cool Ml powered filters
5. Powered by AWS Lambda Functions and Serverless
6. Preprocessing of Data
